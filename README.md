# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Credit Card Financial Power BI Dashboard

I had used a sample dataset from Internet. The files were in CSV format and I created a database in PostGreSQL named CCDB. In which I created two tables cc_detail and cust_detail. Connected this database with Power BI and completed the Dashboard with actionable insights that any one at this hypothetical Credit Card company could work on.

Database information:
cc_detail: This table contains information about credit card transactions. Columns include annual fees, card_category, use_chip, total_trans_amt, expenditure type, Yearly, quarterly, and monthly breakdown of revenue.
cust_detail: This table contains customer information. Columns include customer_id, name, age, gender, employment type, maritial status, and credit_limit. 

MAIN KPIs:
1. Avg Age
2. Avg Income
3. Avg Customer Satisfaction Score
4. Total Revenue
5. Total Cust Acquisition Cost
6. Total Annual Fees
7. Total Transaction Count
8. Total Interest Earned

Visualizations Used:
1. Bar Chart
2. Line and Bar Chart
3. Line Chart
4. Pie Chart
5. Tree Map

Challenges:
1. Data Cleaning: Ensured the data was clean and free from duplicates and errors before importing into PostgreSQL.
Solution: Used Python scripts to clean and preprocess the data before loading it into the database.

3. Data Refresh: Ensured the Power BI dashboard data is up-to-date.
Solution: Set up scheduled refresh in Power BI.
