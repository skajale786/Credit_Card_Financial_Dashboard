# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Credit Card Financial Power BI Dashboard

I had used a sample dataset from Internet. The files were in CSV format and I created a database in PostGreSQL named CCDB. In which I created two tables cc_detail and cust_detail. Connected this database with Power BI and completed the Dashboard with actionable insights that any one at this hypothetical Credit Card company could work on.

Database information:
cc_detail: This table contains information about credit card transactions. Columns include annual fees, card_category, use_chip, total_trans_amt, expenditure type, Yearly, quarterly, and monthly breakdown of revenue.
cust_detail: This table contains customer information. Columns include customer_id, name, age, gender, employment type, maritial status, and credit_limit.
